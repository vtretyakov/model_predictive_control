## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros

  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.

* **Ipopt and CppAD:** Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/blob/master/install_Ipopt_CppAD.md) for installation instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.

## Compilation

### Your code should compile.

The code compiles without errors with cmake and make as described in Basic Build Instructions.  `CMakeLists.txt` was not modified.

## Implementation

### The Model

The model used in the project is a simple global kinematic model that returns the next state vector, given a current state input vector and an actuator vector. The model doesn't include complex interactions of the tires with the road, i.e., it doesn't model dynamics of the vehicle.

![Kinematic model equations](media/kinematic_model.png)

The software implementation looks like the following:

```
x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
y[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
psi[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt
v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt
epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt
```
where:

`x, y` - car's position coordinates,
`psi` - car's heading direction,
`v` - car's velocity,
`cte` - cross-track error,
`epsi` - error in heading direction

These are considered as inputs of the model, where with the help of `Ipopt` solver and `CppAD` given model's constrains like acceleration and steering angle limits, we can find our optimum control outputs:

`a` - car's acceleration (throttle),
`delta` - steering angle

The control outputs are optimal when the solution minimizes our cost functions which are defined as a sum of squared errors cross-track error, steering angle error, error in reference velocity, errors in use of actuators and the rate of their use.
